        MasterCard, Affinity Card, American Express cards, or online payment
        methods (PayPal, for example).
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to validation
        checks and authorization by Your card issuer. If we do not receive the

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Subscriptions</h2>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Subscription Period</h3>
      <p className="mt-2">
        The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid
        Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic
        basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly, or annually), depending on the
        type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew
        under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company
        cancels it.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Subscription Cancellations</h3>
      <p className="mt-2">
        You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account
        settings page or by contacting the Company. You will not receive a
        refund for the fees You already paid for Your current Subscription
        period, and You will be able to access the Service until the end of Your
        current Subscription period.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Billing</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing
        information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone
        number, and a valid payment method information.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will
        issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,
        within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to
        the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Fee Changes</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
        Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at
        the end of the then-current Subscription period.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change
        in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate Your
        Subscription before such change becomes effective.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
        comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified
        Subscription fee amount.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Refunds</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the
        Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of
        the Company.
      </p>
